# Talk Outliner

A tool specifically created for outlining a talk.

## Features

### Writing

- Write an outline with points and indentation.
- Use rich text to write your points.
- Optionally provide a script for a point with more details you can reference
  while practicing.
- Highlight a point with a voice color to indicate a change in tone.
- Export the outline as a JSON file (or save it directly to disk in Chrome) for
  later importing.

### Presenting

- Dedicated view mode for practicing and presenting.
- Toggle each point to display a script for more details.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

### View mode only

- <kbd>right</kbd>, <kbd>down</kbd>, or <kbd>space</kbd> : Focus and expand next
  point

## Tips

- On Chrome desktop, after the first save to a file, saving again automatically
  writes to the file without showing the prompt. This resets after a reload
  though.
- Importing and saving from/to cloud storage providers like iCloud or Google
  Drive is super easy. Store the outlines in the cloud and easily edit them on
  the go.
- The focused point is remembered between views and the app scrolls
  automatically to it. This helps with quick edits while practicing.
